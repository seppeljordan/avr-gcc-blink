This piece of code implements the famous blink example in c.  Use the
avr-gcc compiler to complile your code.  This code should run on
almost any board with slight modifications.  Procedures that have to
be ported are "marked" as not portable in the comments for the
procedures.  You may also change the avr controller model specified in
the Makefile to make the code run on other boards.
